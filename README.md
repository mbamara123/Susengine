## 🚀 Features
- AI-based prediction of recyclability and degradation pathways.
- Database of advanced materials with performance metrics.
- Computational simulations linking structure → property → performance.
- UI dashboard for researchers to visualize results.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (built on lovable.dev)  
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, authentication, APIs)  
- **AI/ML**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- **Hosting**: Vercel
