## ✨ Inspiration

The idea for Susengine was inspired by my background in materials and metallurgical engineering and my commitment to sustainability. During my academic and industrial experiences, I observed the urgent need for efficient water treatment, optimized energy systems, and smarter material design. By merging AI tools with functional materials research, Susengine became a platform to simulate, showcase, and communicate these sustainable innovations.


## 🚀 Features
🛠️ Interactive Modules – Demonstrations of sustainable engineering workflows.

📊 Data Visualization – Graphical insights into energy/material efficiency.

🌍 Sustainability Focus – Emphasis on eco-design, clean processes, and environmental stewardship.

💻 Web-Based – Built with accessible tools for easy deployment and testing.

📚 Documentation – Includes write-ups that connect theory with practice.

- AI-based prediction of recyclability and degradation pathways.
- Database of advanced materials with performance metrics.
- Computational simulations linking structure → property → performance.
- UI dashboard for researchers to visualize results.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (built on lovable.dev)  
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, authentication, APIs)  
- **AI/ML**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. User selects a material (e.g., polymer for energy storage).  
2. System retrieves data from curated database.  
3. AI model predicts recyclability, degradation pathway, and performance.  
4. Results are visualized in the dashboard with recommendations.
